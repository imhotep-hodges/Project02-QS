# Project02-QS

Developer: Larry Hodges
Description: 

IMGWarehouse is a mock website. It's based on Stock photo or GIF collection websites. 
Users can use the search bar to find specific GIF images. 

This is my second project for the Quickstart Fullstack Developer Bootcamp

Technologies used: HTML, SCSS, CSS, JS, JQuery

Ideas for improvement: 

- Continue to practice with Javascript and Jquery so I can add more Objects/Elements to the site. 
- Continue to practice with SCSS and CSS. 
- Get more User Stories
